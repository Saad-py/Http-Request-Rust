# Http-Request-Rust
Headache to make but satisfying when done
it is my My proudest piece of Rust code yet.

There are 4 files in the src directory
auth_err.rs is to just confirm if the requests are working


success_search is to check if the request with everything was succesfull

### search_struct_final
is for the final result where the request is done and is displayed as an object of a class 


Remember to put your apiKey in the apiKey.txt file or else it will not work
